## CitraJournal: A Small Business Financial Reporting Website

CitraJournal is a small business financial reporting website that was developed as my thesis project. The website is designed to make it easier for small businesses to generate accurate and up-to-date financial reports.

CitraJournal is a web-based application that can be accessed from any device with an internet connection. The website is easy to use and requires no prior knowledge of accounting.
